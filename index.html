<h2><b>Are you and your staff prepared for an emergency?</b></h2>

<p>With over 44 years of combined experience, two passionate emergency professionals, 
Ted Bourgeois and Justin J. Prescott formed AEP with one mission: to provide the best quality, 
most engaging, emergency management training for the 911 industry you can receive today. 
Our classes have been designed to bridge the gap between the public and the emergency services 
needed in today’s world. We offer dynamic continuing education programs to give you the tools to 
think critically in an emergency. Training is our passion, and empowering 911 telecommunicators 
is our focus.</p>

<p>AEP will give your 911 center the best first step in being prepared for what is coming next. 
Our training limits mistake-making and builds on basics and fundamentals to create a staff 
that brings resilience and confidence to every incident to which they are exposed. 
This technique lowers stress and develops a work environment that strives for excellence.</p>
